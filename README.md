# Thoughts on Adrian and Filbo
### BY: Casey Maloney

Watching Adrian's presentation on Thursday was informative and interesting. It was thought out well and gave a great insight into Filbo and how they use their architecture.  I liked how he explains the concept of clean architecture. That these concepts of architectural patterns were important principles in data software. I think the patterns like independence, constant cost of change/refactoring, and more brought the idea that we are learning in class today. It tied everything together for me and connected how we use microservices and other architectures in today's world. I also really liked how he explained the anatomy of Filbo. How they use the services were broken down into different parts and he explained each one with careful thought and detail. It helped me understand how other services can structure their company with their service. 

Overall I thought Adrian was amazing. He helped me put to a picture these different services that we have been learning and how they are used today in a real-world application.
